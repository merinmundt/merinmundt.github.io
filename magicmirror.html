                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    A magic mirror is a raspberry pi powered monitor behind a double-sided mirror.
                    It uses the MagicMirrorÂ² open source software which is free and maintained by a big group of
                    enthusiasts.
                    I used a Raspberry Pi integrated, an old monitor and a two-way glass mirror for the build. I also
                    integrated Amazon Alexa to the mirror.
                </p>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for something to do over the summer and wanted to create a hardware/software project
                    and after watching a couple of youtube videos and tutorials, I figured this would be a good project.
                    Plus it also served as a great present for my significant other.

                <h2>Lersons Learnt</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a couple of woodworking skills as well as working with hardware pieces and working with
                    the Raspberry Pi.
