                <p>
                    The Mouve is a social media app that allows users to create and discover events happening around
                    them within a 72 hr time span. It allows users to subscribe to events and get real-time
                    updates (pictures, videos, messages)
                    regarding those events. Users can filter the type of events they want to see and also set a search
                    the radius for the events. The mouve also allows users to create private mouves and invite their friends.

                <p>
                    I wanted to work on a mobile app that I would release to the app stores and a friend of mine
                    gave me the idea and I keep
                    building on it.
